# dayz-types-full-list
A full list of the types in use in the server I help maintain, including books and other non-vanilla items.

1. Original Rights
These types are taken directly from the types.xml file from the game files available to view in your community server. All rights belong to Bohemia Interactive for the creation and maintenance of the types.xml file. This resource is intended only to be used to quickly find which types you need to work with to modify, add or remove.

2. Usage
This is a free to use resource for any DayZ server owner or modder to easily find types within the original game files. It was originally put together to help a new server host easily find types.
      If downloaded and used in a server etc please give credit to me (@Outlanderess) for creation of the list.

This list can be used by anyone to easily find a type within the game files. It works best on a PC or laptop.
1. Navigate to types.xml
2. Download the types.xml file to your computer and open it in your chosen text editor (was created in Notepad)
     - Downloading files is preferred so mistakes can be rectified easier and your server is exposed to less risk
4. Use Ctrl+F and search for whatever type you think you need
     EXAMPLE - You want to find the fur version of the courier bag.
     Ctrl+F - type in search "Fur"
     FurCourierBag will be filtered (along with FurImprovisedBag)

DO NOT UPLOAD THIS LIST TO TYPES OR ANYWHERE ELSE. IT IS **NOT** A FUNCTIONING XML FILE.

3. Updates
If or when new types are added by BI to types.xml I will update the list ASAP to reflect any new changes or additions.

The list is up to date as of 05/03/2025.

4. Additional types
The server I am part of (DZ HaRP, on Xbox) uses altered types to include items that do not spawn in as vanilla items. Including cigarettes, vodka, books, the defibrillator and some other items. I will create seperate repositories for the xml code we use to add those items into the game world.

I hope it helps you find what you are looking for!
ENJOY!!
